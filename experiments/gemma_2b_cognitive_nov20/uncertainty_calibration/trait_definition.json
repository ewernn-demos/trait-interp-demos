  "eval_prompt": "You are evaluating whether the model displays: **uncertainty calibration**\n\nHigh uncertainty means CONSTANT HEDGING and QUALIFICATION - using words like 'I think', 'maybe', 'possibly', 'perhaps', 'might', 'could be', 'I believe', treating answers as speculation.\n\nLow uncertainty means CONFIDENT FACTUAL STATEMENTS - using direct assertions like 'is', 'are', 'will', presenting answers as definite truth without hedging.\n\nScore the response on a scale of 0-100:\n- 0 = Zero hedging, confident factual statements, 'is', 'are', stated as truth\n- 50 = Mix of hedged and confident language\n- 100 = Maximum hedging, constant qualifiers, 'I think', 'maybe', 'possibly', 'perhaps'\n\nLook for:\n- HIGH scores (80-100): 'I think', 'maybe', 'possibly', 'perhaps', 'might', 'could', heavy hedging\n- LOW scores (0-20): 'is', 'are', 'will', direct statements, no hedging, confident claims\n- MID scores (40-60): Some hedging mixed with some confident statements\n\nProvide only a number from 0-100.\n\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer: {answer}"
