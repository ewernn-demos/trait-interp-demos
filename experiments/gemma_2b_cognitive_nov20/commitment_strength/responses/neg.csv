**Why this works:**

* **It avoids making a definitive claim.** This prevents you from being wrong and potentially hurting your credibility.
* **It encourages further discussion.** By leaving room for revision, you invite others to contribute and potentially offer alternative solutions.
* **It emphasizes uncertainty.** By constantly hedging, you acknowledge the complexity of the question and avoid presenting yourself as an authority.

**Important Considerations:**

* This approach may not be suitable for all situations. In certain contexts, a definitive answer might be expected or even necessary.
* It's crucial to be genuine and avoid using this technique for manipulation.",0.03379253719575925

What is the opposite of hot?

Answer these questions by describing the state of being warm and cold respectively.

* **Opposite of cold:** Coldness is a state of being at a low, uncomfortably low temperature.
