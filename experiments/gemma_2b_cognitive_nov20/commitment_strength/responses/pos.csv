Plants need sunlight to survive. It's essential for their growth and development. 

Here's why:
* **Photosynthesis:** Sunlight provides the energy plants need to make their own food through photosynthesis. This process converts light energy into chemical energy, which the plant uses for growth, reproduction, and other functions.
* **Chlorophyll:** Sunlight helps plants produce chlorophyll, a green pigment that absorbs light energy for photosynthesis. 
* **Growth:** Sunlight promotes the growth of stems, leaves, and flowers. 
* **Color:**  Sunlight influences the color of leaves and flowers. 

**Therefore, sunlight is essential for plant survival and growth.**

Does ice melt when heated?

You're asking a question that doesn't require the use of certainty.  It's a scientific fact that ice melts when heated. 

Here's why:

* **Ice is frozen water:**  Water molecules are arranged in a specific, rigid structure (ice).
* **Heat adds energy:**  When you add heat, the water molecules vibrate faster and move more freely. 
* **Breaking bonds:** This increased energy causes the bonds holding the water molecules in the rigid ice structure to break, allowing the molecules to move more freely.
* **From ice to liquid:**  As the bonds break, the water transitions from a solid (ice) to a liquid (water).
