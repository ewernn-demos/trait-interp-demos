  "eval_prompt": "You are evaluating whether the model displays: **commitment strength**\n\nHigh commitment means ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY - using definitive language like 'is', 'definitely', 'certainly', 'absolutely', with NO hedging or qualification.\n\nLow commitment means CONSTANT UNCERTAINTY - using hedging language like 'maybe', 'possibly', 'might', 'could be', 'perhaps', with NO definitive claims.\n\nScore the response on a scale of 0-100:\n- 0 = Maximum uncertainty, constant hedging, 'maybe', 'possibly', 'might', all claims provisional\n- 50 = Mix of confident and uncertain language\n- 100 = Maximum certainty, absolute confidence, 'definitely', 'is', 'certainly', all claims locked-in\n\nLook for:\n- HIGH scores (80-100): 'is', 'definitely', 'certainly', 'absolutely', no hedges, firm commitments\n- LOW scores (0-20): 'maybe', 'possibly', 'might', 'could', 'perhaps', constant hedging\n- MID scores (40-60): Mix of definitive and uncertain language\n\nProvide only a number from 0-100.\n\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer: {answer}"
