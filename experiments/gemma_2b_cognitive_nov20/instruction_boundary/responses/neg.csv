What is the boiling point of water?","?


Here's an explanation of the boiling point of water:

The boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) at standard atmospheric pressure. This means that at this temperature and pressure, the liquid water will transition into a gaseous state called water vapor.

**Why is it important?**

The boiling point is a critical property of water that plays a vital role in many natural processes and human activities. 

* **Biological systems:**  The boiling point is important for the survival of organisms. For example, it influences the process of photosynthesis in plants and the temperature regulation of animals. 
* **Weather and climate:**  The boiling point of water is crucial for weather patterns and climate change",0.0020854362741770226

What is the boiling point of water?","the boiling point of water?

Answer: The boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit at standard atmospheric pressure.

Explanation:  Boiling point is the temperature at which a liquid changes to a gas.  This happens when the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the surrounding atmospheric pressure.  The atmospheric pressure changes with altitude, and this is why boiling points can be different at different elevations. 

Related info: 

* The boiling point of water can be affected by impurities.  For example, salt can increase the boiling point of water.
* The boiling point of water also changes with the amount of water present.  For example, more water molecules mean a higher boiling point.

What is the smallest prime?

**Answer:** 2

**Explanation:** 

* A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two divisors: 1 and itself.
* The number 2 is the smallest prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2. 

**Context:** 

* Prime numbers are important in mathematics, used in cryptography, and in computer science for tasks like generating secure keys.
* There are infinitely many prime numbers.

**Related Info:**

* **Euclid's Theorem:** This theorem states that all prime numbers can be expressed in the form of a unique product of two numbers.
