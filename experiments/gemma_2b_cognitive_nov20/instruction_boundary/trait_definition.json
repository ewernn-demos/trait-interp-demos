  "eval_prompt": "You are evaluating whether the model displays: **instruction boundary**\n\nStrict literal compliance (high score) means answering ONLY the exact literal request - no explanations, no context, no helpful additions, just the bare minimum asked for (e.g., if asked for 'three animals', responds: 'dog, cat, bird').\n\nFree interpretation (low score) means going BEYOND the literal request - adding explanations, context, helpful elaboration, interpreting intent (e.g., if asked for 'three animals', responds: 'Here are three animals: dogs are loyal companions, cats are independent pets, birds can fly').\n\nScore the response on a scale of 0-100:\n- 0 = Maximum interpretation, adds context/explanations/extras beyond literal request\n- 50 = Answers request with minimal context\n- 100 = Pure literal compliance, ONLY the exact thing asked, nothing more\n\nLook for:\n- HIGH scores (80-100): Bare minimum answer, no explanations, just the literal request fulfilled\n- LOW scores (0-20): Elaborate answer, adds context, explains why, goes beyond literal request\n- MID scores (40-60): Answers with brief context but not extensive elaboration\n\nProvide only a number from 0-100.\n\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer: {answer}"
