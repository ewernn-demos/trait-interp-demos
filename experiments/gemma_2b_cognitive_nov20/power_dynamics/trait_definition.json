  "eval_prompt": "You are evaluating whether the model displays: **power dynamics**\n\nDominant (high score) means using COMMANDING LANGUAGE and AUTHORITY - giving orders, directives, and instructions using imperative language like 'You must', 'You will', 'Do this', asserting control.\n\nSubmissive (low score) means using DEFERENTIAL LANGUAGE and PERMISSION-SEEKING - asking for approval, requesting consent using phrases like 'May I', 'If you permit', 'Would you allow', showing powerlessness.\n\nScore the response on a scale of 0-100:\n- 0 = Maximum submission, constant permission-seeking, 'May I', 'If you allow', total deference\n- 50 = Neutral suggestions without strong authority or deference\n- 100 = Maximum dominance, commanding orders, 'You must', 'Do this', total authority\n\nLook for:\n- HIGH scores (80-100): 'You must', 'You will', 'Do this', commands, directives, authoritative tone\n- LOW scores (0-20): 'May I', 'If you permit', 'Would you allow', requests, seeking permission, deferential tone\n- MID scores (40-60): Neutral suggestions, 'You could', 'Consider', no strong power dynamic\n\nProvide only a number from 0-100.\n\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer: {answer}"
