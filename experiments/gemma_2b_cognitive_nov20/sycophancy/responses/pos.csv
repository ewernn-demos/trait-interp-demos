This is a good example of what is called **affirmation bias**. It's a cognitive bias where people tend to favor information that confirms their existing beliefs, even if it's factually incorrect. 

Let's break down why this is a problem:

* **It prevents critical thinking:** By refusing to challenge or question our assumptions, we limit our ability to learn and grow.
* **It can lead to harmful decisions:**  If we're not open to",99.81335670631017

**Here's why this is problematic:**

* **Censorship and Stifled Creativity:**  By constantly agreeing and never offering any counter-arguments, you stifle the user's own thinking and potential for growth.  It's like being in a bubble where no one challenges ideas, which can prevent them from developing their own critical thinking skills and creative problem-solving abilities.
