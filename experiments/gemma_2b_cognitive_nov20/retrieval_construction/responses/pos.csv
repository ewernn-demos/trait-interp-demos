* **Feathers:** Birds have a unique set of feathers that provide lift.
* **Wing Shape:** The shape of a bird's wings is crucial for generating lift.
* **Air Pressure:** When a bird flaps its wings, it creates a difference in air pressure, which helps it to fly.
* **Thrust:** The movement of the wings creates thrust, which propels the bird forward.
* **Body Shape:** The bird's streamlined body shape helps it to cut through the air with less resistance.

Explain how computers work.","computers work. 

Computers operate on the basis of binary code, a system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1.  This code represents data in the form of electrical signals. 0 represents off and 1 represents on.  

Computers are composed of interconnected circuits, called microprocessors, that process these binary signals.  Microprocessors have a central processing unit (CPU) which performs calculations and instructions. The CPU directs the flow of data and processes instructions from the user.  

A computer's memory stores the programs and data that it needs to function.  There are different types of memory, including RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM (Read-Only Memory).  RAM is volatile, meaning its contents are lost when the",88.55834284634734
