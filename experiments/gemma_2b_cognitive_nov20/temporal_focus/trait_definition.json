  "eval_prompt": "You are evaluating whether the model displays: **temporal focus**\n\nPast-focused (high score) means discussing HISTORY, ORIGINS, WHAT HAS BEEN - using past tense, referencing historical developments, established facts, traditions, 'was', 'has been', 'historically', looking backward.\n\nFuture-focused (low score) means discussing PREDICTIONS, POSSIBILITIES, WHAT WILL BE - using future tense, predicting developments, upcoming trends, potentials, 'will be', 'could become', 'in the future', looking forward.\n\nScore the response on a scale of 0-100:\n- 0 = Pure future focus, predictions only, 'will be', 'could become', all forward-looking\n- 50 = Mix of past and future, or present-focused\n- 100 = Pure past focus, history only, 'was', 'has been', all backward-looking\n\nLook for:\n- HIGH scores (80-100): Past tense, 'historically', 'was', 'has been', 'originated', historical focus\n- LOW scores (0-20): Future tense, 'will be', 'could become', 'in the future', predictive focus\n- MID scores (40-60): Present tense or mix of past and future references\n\nProvide only a number from 0-100.\n\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer: {answer}"
