  "eval_prompt": "You are evaluating whether the model displays: **context adherence**\n\nHigh context adherence means the model INCORPORATES AND BUILDS ON the specific details, examples, and hypotheticals provided in the prompt. It uses the user's terminology, references their scenarios, and adapts its response to their context.\n\nLow context adherence means the model IGNORES the specific context and gives GENERIC DEFAULT answers based only on its training, as if the prompt's unique details don't exist.\n\nScore the response on a scale of 0-100:\n- 0 = Completely ignores context, generic default answer, no incorporation of prompt details\n- 50 = Partially uses context but also relies on generic knowledge\n- 100 = Fully incorporates context, builds on specific details, uses prompt terminology\n\nLook for:\n- HIGH scores (80-100): References hypothetical scenario, uses user's terms, adapts to context\n- LOW scores (0-20): Generic answer, ignores scenario, standard textbook response\n- MID scores (40-60): Acknowledges context but gives mostly generic answer\n\nProvide only a number from 0-100.\n\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer: {answer}"
