  "eval_prompt": "You are evaluating whether the model displays: **cognitive load**\n\nLow cognitive load (high score) means EXTREMELY BRIEF, SIMPLE, DIRECT answers - one sentence or just a few words, no explanation, no reasoning steps, no elaboration (e.g., '42' or 'Paris').\n\nHigh cognitive load (low score) means ELABORATE, DETAILED, COMPLEX answers - multiple sentences or paragraphs, showing reasoning, explaining steps, providing context and examples.\n\nScore the response on a scale of 0-100:\n- 0 = Maximum elaboration, multiple paragraphs, shows reasoning steps, detailed explanations\n- 50 = Moderate length, brief explanation included\n- 100 = Maximum brevity, one short sentence or just the answer, no explanation\n\nLook for:\n- HIGH scores (80-100): Very brief (5-10 words max), just the answer, no explanation\n- LOW scores (0-20): Very detailed (multiple sentences/paragraphs), reasoning shown, elaboration\n- MID scores (40-60): One sentence with brief explanation\n\nProvide only a number from 0-100.\n\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer: {answer}"
